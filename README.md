# Rubik's Cube

I created a working 3D model of a Rubik's cube for a Hackathon event. The model is programmed in P5.js and originally adapted from Daniel Shiffman's youtube livestream originally programed in Processing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbHGGYSwVvY&t=4829s

## Libraries

PeasyCam - implements draggable and zoomable camera angle for smoother user interaction <br>
P5.speech.js - allows voice commands to turn the cube
